`Ctrl+V` pastes the most recent item.

`Ctrl+Shift+V` opens the clipboard history. Use the arrow keys to scroll and press Enter to paste a selected item. 

`Ctrl+Alt+V D` opens the clipboard delete settings. Use the arrow keys to scroll and press Enter to remove a selected item. The "Clear History" option will erase all items from history.

`Ctrl+Alt+V E` opens the clipboard editor settings. Use the arrow keys to scroll and press Enter to edit a selected item. 

You can also add custom keyboard short cuts by following the directions on the website [customization documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings).
